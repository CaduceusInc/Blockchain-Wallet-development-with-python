# Blockchain-Wallet-development-with-python

So, Deep learning/ Reinforcement learning is difficult on its own. As I have learnt, it is not enough to just know what a model does or how to build it from scratch or how to optimize it. Also, if you only have a superficial knowledge of the language you're working with, you're bound to struggle. I have a passable understanding of python, but if I really want to build products/projects I dream about, I need to 'speak the language' fluently.

This is a side project; the appetizer before the real work of deploying exciting ML models. I plan to update it regularly, just as soon as  I find the right syntax to make the wallet work.
